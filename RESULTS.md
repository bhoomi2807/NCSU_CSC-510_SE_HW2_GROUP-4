## Methods
#### Observations from Google Form
1. Familiarity with language.
2. Quality of written code.
3. Ease of understanding the language.

#### Manual Observations
1. Time taken to find bug.
2. Time to resolve bug.

## Materials
The experiment was conducted with the help of:
1. Zoom: For conducting half an hour session with each participant.
2. Google Form: To anonymously capture experiment results/opinions from each participant.
3. Google Sheet: Observations from our side with respect to each participant.

### Preference of languages

- From the data we observe that most of the participants were hardly familiar with any of the programming languages.
- They found the quality of code really good and easy to follow through.

## Conclusion


## Threats to Validity
1) Some of the bugs required a deeper understanding of the algorithm and non-trivial inputs. This confused some of the participants.
2) Julia was relatively new to most of our testers, which made them a little skeptical about using this language in the future.
